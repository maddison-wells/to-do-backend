# To-Do List Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the To-Do List application! This backend server provides the necessary functionality to manage tasks efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the To-Do List backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.

Ensure that you have the frontend server running as well, as the frontend communicates with the backend to perform CRUD operations on tasks.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **RESTful API**: Implements a RESTful API design for easy integration with frontend applications.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes a database to store and retrieve task data, ensuring data persistence and reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.
- **Security**: Implements security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
- **Integration with Frontend**: Seamlessly integrates with the linked frontend application, enabling a cohesive user experience.
- **Spring Swagger**: Utilizes Spring Swagger to document and visualize the API endpoints, making it easy to understand and interact with the backend services.
- **Logging**: Implements logging functionality to track application behavior and diagnose issues effectively.

## Usage

Once the backend server is running, it will listen for requests from the frontend application to perform CRUD operations on tasks. The frontend application communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to access and modify task data.

## Developed with Spring and Java

This backend server was developed using Spring and Java, providing robustness, scalability, and reliability. It was built using Eclipse IDE, ensuring a streamlined development process.
